<h2>Data Visualization Project</h2>
<p><strong>Data</strong></p>
<p>The primary data source for this project will be player ratings from the EAFC24 database, accessible via <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/ea-sports-fc-24-complete-player-dataset">Kaggle</a>. These comprehensive ratings for soccer players will be supplemented with additional statistics to provide a multi-faceted view of player performance.</p>

<p><strong>Questions & Tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Data acquisition and cleaning from the EAFC24 database for visualization readiness.</li>
  <li>Creation of an interactive spider chart for visualizing individual player ratings across multiple metrics.</li>
  <li>Development of parallel coordinate plots for multi-player performance comparison.</li>
  <li>Design of a customizable scatter plot for pairwise metric comparison among players.</li>
  <li><em>Exploration of heatmaps for depicting player performance variations across different conditions or times.</em></li>
  <li><em>Integration of bar charts to clearly present specific statistics such as goals scored or assists.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sketches</strong></p>
<p>The project will feature an interactive full-screen visualization comprising:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Interactive Spider Chart:</strong> Users can select a player to view a spider chart representing their ratings.</li>
  <li><strong>Parallel Coordinate Plot:</strong> A graphical tool for multi-player performance analysis with interactive filtering and customization.</li>
  <li><strong>Customizable Scatter Plot:</strong> A dynamic plot allowing users to select metrics for X and Y axes to compare players.</li>
  <li><em>Newly Proposed Visualizations:</em> Incorporating heatmaps and bar charts for enhanced data representation and user interactivity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prototypes</strong></p>
<p>Note: The following images are conceptual representations aiming to be replicated with enhancements in the project.</p>

<h2>Open Questions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Integration of interactive features such as brushing in the parallel coordinate plot and dynamic updates in the scatter plot for a seamless user experience.</li>
  <li>Intuitive interface design for easy customization without overwhelming users with the data's complexity.</li>
  <li>Ensuring visualization responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes for universal accessibility.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Milestones</h2>
<p><strong>Week 1: Initialization</strong></p>
<p>Setup the GitHub repository and gather the initial data from EAFC24.</p>
<p><strong>Week 2: Data Preprocessing</strong></p>
<p>Clean and preprocess the data. Begin sketching the spider chart design with potential inclusion of new visualization types based on feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Week 3: Spider Chart Development</strong></p>
<p>Implement basic interactivity for the spider chart and explore heatmap and bar chart designs.</p>
<p><strong>Week 4: Parallel Coordinates</strong></p>
<p>Develop the parallel coordinate plot, integrating basic interactive features and user feedback mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Week 5: Scatter Plot and Additional Visualizations</strong></p>
<p>Code the customizable scatter plot and incorporate preliminary designs for heatmaps and bar charts.</p>
<p><strong>Week 6: Interactivity Enhancement and Refinement</strong></p>
<p>Refine interactivity across all visualizations, focusing on user engagement and the readability of complex data.</p>
<p><strong>Week 7 and 8: User Testing, Final Adjustments, and Documentation</strong></p>
<p>Conduct thorough testing, iterate based on user feedback, and finalize project documentation.</p>
